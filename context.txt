Real-Time Defect Detection System Documentation
Overview
Automated visual inspection system for identifying defects in plastic bottles on a production line
Uses computer vision to detect, classify, and track defective bottles in real-time, storing results in a database for quality control analysis
Key Features
Real-time bottle inspection using camera feed
Defect classification into 4 categories:
water level issues
bottle/plastic damage
label problems (damaged/missing)
general defects/wrong bottle types
Unique ID assignment per bottle
Automated image capture of defective items
SQL database logging
Requirements
Hardware
processing unit options:
Kaggle/google colab online for training
Macbook m4 air for inference
optional: gate/sorting mechanism for physical separation
Just webcam (conveyor movement will be simulated via rudimentary methods)
Tech Stack
computer vision: opencv
deep learning: custom trained object detection model (tensorflor/pytorch)
object tracking: opencv tracking algorithms
database: sqlite
language: python
hardware acceleration: cuda (nvidia gpu)
database: sql database (SQLite)
gui: tkinter

System Architecture
Detection Pipeline
object detection: identifies bottles and defects using trained model
object tracking: assigns unique IDs to prevent duplicate checks
classification: categorizes defect type
data logging: stores defect info, ID, timestamp, and image path in database
image archival: saves photo of defective bottle with ID reference
Database Schema
defects_table:
- id (unique bottle identifier)
- timestamp
- defect_type (water_level/bottle_damage/label_issue/general)
- image_path
Frontend Design
minimal dashboard showing:
live camera feed with bounding boxes
real-time defect counter by type
recent defect log
batch statistics/error percentage
 
Backend
continuous video processing loop
frame-by-frame object detection
tracking algorithm maintains bottle IDs across frames
defect classification logic
database insertion on defect detection
image file management system
Training Requirements
model needs training data for:
normal bottles
defective bottles (various types)
labels (normal and damaged)
background/conveyor environment
minimum 500-1000 labeled images per category recommended for decent accuracy
Defect Classes
Good 100
No label 60
Label damage 60
No cap 60
Dent/crack 60
